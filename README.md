## Features

  * **Live Score Updates:** Fetches and displays scores in real-time for ongoing NBA games.
  * **Easy to Use:** Simple command-line interface for quick access to scores.
  * **Customizable:** (Future enhancement) Potential for customizing which games or statistics to display.

-----

## Motivation

As big NBA fans, we often want to keep up with live game scores without constantly refreshing a browser or sifting through complex sports apps. This project aims to be a light, efficient way to get live updates directly from a reliable source, focusing on the key info you need for a quick glance.

-----

## Technologies Used

  * **Python 3.12:** The primary programming language.
  * **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to fetch web page content.
  * **BeautifulSoup4  (bs4):** For parsing HTML content and extracting data.
  * **Selenium :** (Potentially) If the NBA site uses a lot of JavaScript to render content, `selenium` might be necessary to simulate a browser and load dynamic content. This would require a compatible WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
  * **Time:** For implementing delays between scraping requests to avoid overwhelming the target server.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Roozbehsn/nba-live-scoreboard-scraper.git
    cd nba-live-scoreboard-scraper
    ```

2.  **Install necessary libraries manually:**
    This project relies on a few external Python libraries that you'll need to install yourself. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install selenium
    ```

    If you're using **`selenium`**, you'll also need to download the appropriate **WebDriver** for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox) and ensure it's accessible in your system's PATH, or specify its location in your Python script.

-----

## Usage

To run the live scoreboard:

```bash
python NBA.py
```

The script will fetch and display the live scores, refreshing at a set interval (e.g., every 10-15 seconds). You can stop the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

**Example Output:**

```
Loading NBA games page for 2025-06-05...

Found 1 game(s):
Pacers (111) vs Thunder (110)
```
